sfConsolePlugin
===============

Provides a php shell with completion capabilities.

Installation
------------

  * Install the plugin

        $ symfony plugin:install sfConsolePlugin

  * You're all set !

Use the console
---------------

The console is started with the `console:run` task. You should be able
enter any valid PHP code, and the console will try its best to
evaluate it.

Features
--------

  * `readline` support. Basically it means you get an history of what
    you previously typed
  * Oh, by the way, that history will persist accross sessions
  * Completion for built-in and user defined functions, classes and
    constants
  * Exceptions are catched and you can get the backtrace separately

Limitations
-----------

Since the code gets eval()'d, and since some parts of PHP
like error management are a bit crappy (also, I'm a bit lazy),
there are some known limitations that I don't plan to work on:

  * Not loaded classes can not be completed (those loaded with
    the autoload for example)
  * Variables can't be tab-completed
  * Fatal errors in the eval()'d scripts will terminate the console
  * Error messages and Exceptions' backtraces won't feature useful
    line numbers

Special commands
----------------

  * `exit`: exits the console (amazing heh)
  * `help`: not yet implemented
  * `backtrace`: display the last exception's backtrace if any

Todo
----

  * Support for multi-line constructs
  * Support to run symfony tasks from within the console
  * Better command completion
