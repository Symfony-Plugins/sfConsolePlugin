sfConsolePlugin
===============

Provides a php shell with completion capabilities.

Installation
------------

  * Install the plugin

        $ symfony plugin:install sfConsolePlugin

  * You're all set !

Use the console
---------------

The console is started with the `console:run` task. You should be able
enter any valid PHP code, and the console will try its best to
evaluate it. Since the code gets eval()'d, and since some parts of PHP
like error management are a bit crappy, there are some known
limitations that I don't plan to work on:

  * Fatal errors in the eval()'d scripts will terminate the console
  * Error messages and Exceptions' backtraces won't feature useful
    line numbers

Special commands
----------------

  * `exit`: exits the console (amazing heh)
  * `help`: not yet implemented
  * `backtrace`: display the last exception's backtrace if any

Todo
----

  * Support for multi-line constructs
  * Support to run symfony tasks from within the console
  * Better command completion
